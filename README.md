# Heart-Attack-Diagnosis-using-Machine-Learning

Heart disease remains one of the most significant causes of death worldwide. Early identification of high-risk individuals can reduce mortality rates by enabling timely medical intervention. Traditional methods rely on clinical judgment, which can be subjective and inefficient. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts heart disease risk based on patient attributes.

Data Source:
The dataset used for this study was derived from multiple sources and combined into a single dataset, 'heart.csv.' It contains 13 independent variables and 1 target variable, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
